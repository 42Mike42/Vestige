Perfect! Now I can see the full picture. Your librarian is working through Ollama's command line interface, which is totally fine. The embedding model integration would be a separate component that works alongside this.

For the next step (adding the embedding model), you'd probably want to add a function like this to your `librarian_llm.py`:

```python
import requests

def get_embedding(text: str):
    """Get embedding for text using Nomic model via Ollama API"""
    try:
        response = requests.post('http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings', 
                               json={'model': 'nomic-embed-text', 'prompt': text})
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()['embedding']
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Embedding error: {e}")
        return None
```

Then in your main app, you'd store embeddings with each memory and use them for semantic search. You could modify the memory dictionary to include:

```python
memory = {
    "id": str(uuid.uuid4())[:8],
    "content": user_input,
    "embedding": get_embedding(user_input),  # Add this
    "score": round(result.get("score", 0.5), 2),
    "timestamp": datetime.datetime.now(),
    "categories": result.get("tags", ["üóÇÔ∏è Uncategorized"]),
    "reason": result.get("reason", "No reason given.")
}
```

The reason Copilot might have mentioned "loading" could be that the Ollama API endpoint (`http://localhost:11434`) needs to be running, and the `nomic-embed-text` model needs to be available. You can check with:
- `ollama list` (to see what models you have)
- `ollama pull nomic-embed-text` (if you need to download it)

Does that align with what you and Copilot were planning?
