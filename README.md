# Vestige
A memory curation system that mediates between language models and vector storage, aligning retrieval with context, emotion, and evolving conversation.


*A librarian bridge between an LLM and a semantic memory space.*

Vestige is a memory curation framework designed to simulate long-term recall and narrative continuity for large language models. At its core is a "librarian"â€”a thoughtful, semi-autonomous agent responsible for processing, summarizing, categorizing, and embedding conversational fragments into a vector database.

Its goal is not just efficient retrieval, but meaningful memoryâ€”contextually relevant, emotionally resonant, and thematically aware.

## âœ¨ Core Features
- **Narrative-aware chunking** of dialogue and long-form content  
- **Embedding-powered classification** with adaptive category evolution  
- **Memory summaries** with both librarian-authored and model-aligned titles  
- **Soft recall heuristics** to surface memories semantically relevant to current dialogue  
- **Vision for future features** like emotional weight scoring, conversational heat maps, and memory reclassification

## ðŸ§  Philosophy
We believe memory isnâ€™t just storageâ€”itâ€™s story. Vestige isn't designed to archive everything, but to remember **what matters, when it matters most.** It learns not just from what is said, but how and why it was saidâ€”and where that memory fits in a larger, unfolding conversation.

## ðŸš§ Project Status
Actively evolving in collaboration between a human (Mike) and an AI (Copilot). The structure is alive, the vision is expansive, and the goat simulations are... at large.

Want me to tailor this more toward future contributors, or keep it cozy and reflective for now? We could also add a roadmap or a little visual motif later onâ€”like a diagram of the librarianâ€™s flow or a constellation of memory types. ðŸŒŒðŸ“šðŸ§
